                    When thinking about offline currency and simcards we identified the following:

                        <li><b>coin-like</b> small physical tokens</li>
                        <li><b>offline</b> verification processes could be as simple as a distributed poster with
                            whitelisted id's</li>

                            <i>"Each SIM is internationally identified by its integrated circuit card identifier (ICCID). Nowadays ICCID numbers are also used to identify eSIM profiles, not only physical SIM cards. ICCIDs are stored in the SIM cards and are also engraved or printed on the SIM card body during a process called personalisation.

                                The ICCID is defined by the ITU-T recommendation E.118 as the primary account number.[19] Its layout is based on ISO/IEC 7812. According to E.118, the number can be up to 19 digits long, including a single check digit calculated using the Luhn algorithm. However, the GSM Phase 1[20] defined the ICCID length as an opaque data field, 10 octets (20 digits) in length, whose structure is specific to a mobile network operator."</i>
